## Purpose
The idea behind this site was to bring some knowledge about the Portuguese and Brazilian gastronomy. There are a lot of sites with massive information regarding culture and food from both countries but on this one, the focus is to centralize and put together some of the most common and representative products.
The portfolio of recipes will provide some basic information about each product and then, if the user wants to get additional information, should contact us by filling the form. 
This site was built with basic functionality and navigation but soon, more advanced features will be deployed such as online orders, request of recipes, requests for further information regarding specific locations (travelling, hotels) and feedback from users. 

The live website can be found [here](https://baptistapaulo.github.io/pp1/index.html).

### Left-to-Implement
* Orders online for delivery of some selected products from the portfolio but this will require a secure link for payments and security compliance.
* A blog also may be created but only accessible to members, requiring therefore a registration and sign in.
* A database with multiple recipes may be deployed as a back-end engine to provide a feed of different products, so that every month for example, the front end can swift some of the recipes based on a voting scheme from members.
* Gallery images with the recepy attached underneath.

### Testing-Issues
Unfixed Bugs
To mention unfixed bugs and why they were not fixed. This section should include shortcomings of the frameworks or technologies used. 
* Issue 1 if any found

## Deployment
### Project-Creation
#### Github-Pages
Repository
1. Navigate to the GitHub [Repository:](https://github.com/baptistapaulo/pp1)
1. Click the 'Settings' Tab.
1. Scroll Down to the Git Hub Pages Heading.
1. Select 'Master Branch' as the source.
1. Click the Save button.
1. Click on the link to go to the live deployed page.
### Locally
Clone
1. Navigate to the GitHub [Repository:](https://github.com/baptistapaulo/pp1)
1. Click the Code drop down menu.
1. Either Download the ZIP file, unpackage locally and open with IDE (This route ends here) OR Copy Git URL from the HTTPS dialogue box.
1. Open your developement editor of choice and open a terminal window in a directory of your choice.
1. Use the 'git clone' command in terminal followed by the copied git URL.
1. A clone of the project will be created locally on your machine.
### Fork
Most commonly, forks are used to either propose changes to someone else's project to which you do not have write access, or to use someone else's project as a starting point for your own idea. You can fork a repository to create a copy of the repository and make changes without affecting the upstream repository.
So a fork is a copy of a repository. Forking a repository allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project.
1. Navigate to the GitHub Repository you want to fork.
1. On the top right of the page under the header, click the fork button.
1. Create a new fork.
1. This will create a duplicate of the full project in your GitHub Repository.
### Commands
* `CTRL + S` was used to save the page
* `CTRL + Z` was used to undo a change
* `python3 -m http.server` was used to view and test site before pushing live
* `git add` was used to add pages to the stage area
* `git commit -m "fix: message here"` was used to comit them them to github and provide a relevant message to the changes that had been made.
* `git push` was used to push the changes upto Github for public viewing.

## Comments
the Git Pages contains two different deployments due to a change on the repository name
`github-pages at 307921d` refers to a previous website (**baptistapaulo.github.io/baptistapaulo-pp1.github.io/**)
`github-pages at bd31b90` refers to current website (**baptistapaulo.github.io/pp1/**)
