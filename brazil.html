                    <p>
                        PREPARATION:
                        Step 1 - In a medium heavy-based saucepan, heat the butter, condensed milk, a pinch of salt and
                        the cocoa, to boiling, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon. Reduce the heat to medium-low;
                        cook for 10-15 mins, stirring constantly, until the mixture is thick and shiny and starts to
                        pull away from the bottom.
                        Step 2 - Stir in the vanilla and vigorously mix again. Pour the mixture onto a buttered plate.
                        Chill for at least 2 hrs.
                        Step 3 - Butter your hands and pinch off some of the dough to make 2.5cm balls. Place your
                        toppings into small bowls and roll the balls of one of the decorations. Place in mini paper
                        baking cups or on a tray lined with non-stick baking paper.

                    <p>
                        INGREDIENTS:
                        for 8 servings
                        1 tablespoon butter
                        14 oz sweetened condensed milk(395 g)
                        ¼ cup cocoa powder(30 g)
                        1 cup chocolate sprinkle(160 g), as needed

                    <p>
                        PREPARATION:
                        Step 1 - Heat a large heavy-based saucepan with a fitted lid, add the bacon and fry until crisp.
                        Remove and keep the oil in the pan. In batches sear the ribs, sausages and pork shoulder. Season
                        each batch with salt and pepper.
                        Step 2 - Remove the meat and set aside. Add the onion, garlic and chilli to the pan. Pour in a
                        little olive oil if it needs more. Season with salt and pepper and fry for 8 mins or until soft.
                        Step 3 - Add the meat, bay leaves, white wine vinegar and drained beans. Cover with just enough
                        water to cover, about 650ml. Bring to a boil and reduce the heat to a low simmer. Cover and cook
                        for 2 hrs, or until the beans are soft and the meat is tender. If there is too much liquid in
                        the pot take the lid off in the last hr. You can also use a slow cooker on the short method (4
                        hr) or make a quick version using a pressure cooker in batches for 30 mins each. Another method
                        is to cook it in the oven for 3-4 hrs at 160C/140C fan/gas 3.
                        Step 4 - Serve with rice, a sprinkle of parsley or coriander, hot pepper sauce and orange
                        slices.

                        INGREDIENTS:
                        250g dried black bean, soaked overnight, then drained
                        100g streaky smoked bacon, cut into slices
                        500g pork rib
                        3 chorizo cooking sausages
                        500g pork shoulder, cut into 5cm cubes
                        3 onions, chopped
                        4 garlic cloves, finely chopped
                        pinch of chilli flakes
                        olive oil, for cooking
                        2 bay leaves
                        2 tbsp white wine vinegar

                    <br>
                    <p>
                        PREPARATION:
                        Step 1 - You can make the dough by hand or use a food processor. Place the flour in a large bowl
                        or food processor with some salt. Add the vegetable shortening and mix well or pulse until it
                        makes crumbs. Stir in the egg, vinegar and the rum, then pour the water gradually until the
                        mixture comes together as a dough. Knead the mixture once more, wrap in cling film and chill for
                        1 hr.
                        Step 2 - Make the filling by heating the oil in a frying pan. Add the onion and garlic and
                        season. Fry for 5 mins until soft and add the tomatoes, parsley and hearts of palm. Fry for
                        another min and remove from heat.
                        Step 3 - Halve the dough and using a floured surface, roll out the dough into a large square
                        about 30cm X 30cm. Use a pastry cutter to make 6 squares. Repeat with the second piece of dough.
                        If it’s too soft, place it in the fridge, before adding the filling, to firm up again.
                        Step 4 - Using a pastry brush lightly brush the edges of the square with water. Add 2 tbsp of
                        the filling, a tiny dollop of cream cheese and fold over. Use a fork to press the edges together
                        and seal. Chill until ready to fry. Place the pastries on a layer of baking paper, top with
                        another and then wrap in cling film to stay dry until using.
                        Step 5 - Heat 7.5-10cm vegetable oil in a wok or small heavy saucepan. It’s ready when a small
                        piece of bread dropped in sizzles immediately. Fry the pastels in batches for about 2-3 mins or
                        until golden brown and bubbly. Drain on kitchen paper and fry the rest. Serve warm with napkins.

                        3 xícaras de farinha de trigo
                        1 xícara de água morna (ou um pouco mais)
                        3 colheres (sopa) de óleo (de soja, milho, girassol ou algodão)
                        1 colher (sopa) de aguardente

                        PREPARATION:
                        Step 1 - Heat oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. Rub 4 ramekins, about 175ml capacity, or dariole
                        moulds liberally with the soft butter. Sprinkle with the caster sugar to coat.
                        Step 2 - In a medium bowl, press the egg yolks through a wire sieve and mix with the coconut
                        milk, sugar, coconut and vanilla. Pour into ramekins and place in a large roasting tin in the
                        oven.
                        Step 3 - Pour water into the roasting tin to three-quarters up the ramekins so it acts like a
                        bain marie or water bath for the quindim. Bake for 30-35 mins until the tops are golden. Take
                        the ramekins out of the water and leave to cool for 5 mins.
                        Step 4 - Chill for 4 hrs and then run a knife around the edge. Place a plate on top and turn out
                        the quindims to serve.

                        PREPARATION:
                        Step 1 - Heat the oven to 220C/200C fan/gas 7. Oil or butter a baking sheet and set aside.
                        Step 2 - Heat the milk, butter and salt in a medium saucepan and bring to a boil. Remove from
                        the heat and add the tapioca flour. Stir vigorously, then leave to cool a little.
                        Step 3 - Pour the dough into a standing mix to beat the dough until its cool, or use a wooden
                        spoon and beat by hand. Beat the eggs in one at a time, waiting until each is completely
                        incorporated before adding the next. When the dough is glossy and mixed, add the parmesan. Beat
                        again until mixed.
                        Step 4 - Spoon the dough onto the baking sheet in 1 tbsp balls, 5cm apart. Bake for 30 mins
                        until crisp and golden. Remove from the oven and eat while still warm.

                    <p>
                        PREPARATION:
                        Step 1 - Bring a pan of salted water to the boil, then reduce to a simmer. Poach the chicken
                        very gently for 10 mins. Remove from the heat, cover and cook for 10-15 mins more until cooked
                        through. Use a slotted spoon to remove the chicken and leave to cool. Reserve the poaching
                        liquid.
                        Step 2 - Bring the liquid to the boil, add the potatoes and simmer for 15-20 mins until just
                        tender. Drain, then leave to dry out before mashing and seasoning.
                        Step 3 - Meanwhile, heat the olive oil in a pan, add the onion and stir over a medium-low heat
                        for 8-10 mins. To assemble, shred the chicken in a bowl, mix in the mash, onions and marinade,
                        then taste and season. With damp hands, shape about 50g of mixture into a teardrop shape. Set it
                        upright on a plate and repeat with the rest of the mixture. Coat each in flour, egg and
                        breadcrumbs. Cover with cling film and chill for at least 1 hr.
                        Step 4 - Heat the vegetable oil in a deep fryer or large saucepan to 170C or until a piece of
                        bread browns in 30 secs. Fry in batches for 3-4 mins until golden, turning once or twice. Remove
                        and drain on kitchen paper. Serve warm with the parsley scattered over.
